                Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Kif might! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Um, is this
                the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? You know, I was God once. My fellow Earthicans, as I
                have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance
                of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Son, as your lawyer, I declare
                y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service
                cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known
                universe!

                Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! I was having the most wonderful
                dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Oh God, what have I done? Oh, but you
                can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And
                by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright,
                I'll get you some stupid food. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Our love isn't any different from yours,
                except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you
                always dress like you're doing your laundry? Now what?
